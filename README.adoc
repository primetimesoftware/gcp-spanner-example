= Spring Cloud GCP Cloud Spanner Starter Example

This code example demonstrates how to read and write POJOs from Google Cloud Spanner using the Spring.
The example was originally copied from the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp[Spring Cloud GCP Repo]

This example creates a trades database and populates it with examples.

You can retrieve all `Trade` objects in the repository by using
`curl http://<app url>/trades`, or any specific trade via
`curl http://<app url>/trades/<trader_id>,<trade_id>`.

This is achieved using https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest/:[Spring Data REST] and the `@RepositoryRestResource` annotation.

You can also write trades using
`curl -XPOST -H"Content-Type: application/json" -d@test.json http://<app url>/trades/` where the file `test.json` holds the JSON representation of a `Trade` object.
